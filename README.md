0x1D. C - Binary trees
Description
A binary tree is a data structure that is made up of nodes. Each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. A binary tree can be used to store data in a hierarchical manner, allowing for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. Binary trees are commonly used in computer science for a variety of tasks, such as storing data in a sorted order, implementing efficient search algorithms, and more.
